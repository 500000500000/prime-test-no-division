# Prime Test Without Division

The function is_prime(n) is implemented and tested.
It returns true if n is an odd prime.

## Limitations

The input n must be odd.

The function incorrectly reports that 1 is prime, but this is a modern complaint. The table of primes compiled by Edward Hinkley in 1850 does include the number 1.
